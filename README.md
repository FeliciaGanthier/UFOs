**UFO Sighting Analysis**

#**Overview of Project**

I am working with Dana, a Data Journalist, on a project about her hometown, McMinnville, OR.  In addition to an opportunity to visit her hometown, Dana will explore a topic that has interested her since childhood. McMinnville is famous for UFO sightings and has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. 
Dana would like to build a table to hold and neatly display the data we are working with. We will then add filters so users can refine their search. The page will also feature an attention-grabbing header, article summary and brief article about UFO sightings.  

Basic HTML, Bootstrap and CSS will be used to build and style the page. JavaScript code will be written in Visual Studio. 

##*Purpose of Analysis*

Using JavaScript, Dana and I will build a dynamic webpage that presents a table of UFO sightings in a visually appealing layout and interacts with users. 

###**Results**

After the initial draft of the page was working, we decided to update our code to allow users to look for multiple criteria at the same time. The final product will have table filters for date, city, state, country and shape. 

Users will begin their search here:

They will enter their search criteria such as state or country to narrow the results.

![Filter By Country, Ex. Canada](https://github.com/FeliciaGanthier/UFOs/blob/master/Image%203.png)

####**Summary**

Our table works as intended; however, the data is limited to sightings in January. I recommend adding additional sightings. To make the page more professional looking, I suggest the following edits to the data:

•	Capitalize City, State and Country Names
•	Capitalize Shape Descriptions
•	Standardize Duration Format

As more data becomes available, the table could also be filtered using drop-down menus for user input.
